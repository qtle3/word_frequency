# Word Frequency Counter

This Python script calculates and displays the frequency of words in a specified text file. It reads the contents of the file, counts the occurrences of each word, and then outputs the words sorted by their frequency.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **File Handling**: The script demonstrates how to open, read, and process the contents of a text file using Python's built-in `open()` function.

- **Word Counting**: The script counts the occurrences of each word in the text file and stores them in a dictionary, where the keys are the words and the values are their respective frequencies.

- **Sorting**: The script sorts the words by their frequency using a custom sorting function (`byFreq`), making it easy to identify the most and least common words.

- **Input Handling**: The script prompts the user to enter the name of the text file to be analyzed, ensuring flexibility in processing different files.
