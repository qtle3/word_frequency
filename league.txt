On the opposing side, Darius, the Hand of Noxus, swung his mighty axe with unrelenting fury. As the skirmish intensified, Ahri, the Nine-Tailed Fox, darted through the battlefield, charming enemies and turning the tide. Meanwhile, Jhin, the Virtuoso, positioned himself from afar, meticulously aiming his shots to wreak havoc. In the end, the clash of champions left the land scarred, but the spirit of the League remained unbroken, ready for the next epic confrontation.
